^c^d hide subtree
^c^s show subtree

- optimize write and add benchmark
 - buffer
  - maybe add fd to buf as an option to dump when full
 
- have skip white ignore ANSI/VT100 escape sequences
 - will need to parse each code to determine length

- docs
 - doxygen

- alternate type for _Str of 1K or 4K string blocks reused



- multiple threads
 - could have free thread to put nodes back in cache
 - could have parsing in background
  - block if node has not been read yet
   - need flag indicating still being read
 - could parse in one thread and have callback build nodes
